	Versions that Worked very well
	
	
Accepted
I should use one sdk 6.2 GA1 and deploy it on different portal. 
I have to leave the SDK to GA1 and change only the Liferay target runtime.

For example:
 Liferay Plugins SDK: liferay-plugins-sdk-6.2 (GA1)
 Liferay target runtime: Liferay v6.2 CE (GA2) (Tomcat 7)

 The theme works well in all versions.
